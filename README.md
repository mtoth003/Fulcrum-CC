Traning Site Page Review

1. I thnk an option to mark a script as complete would be useful, certainly for the Annual and Semi-Annual scripts.
2. For weekly scripts, an option to indicate which day of the week they'll complete could be helpful as well, escpecially if there is more than the one that is visible on the screenshot.
3. Another useful feature could be filter, either by Procedure Type or Frequency. If an option to mark complete existed, that could be a useful feature as well.
4. If this is customizeable for each user, being able to add some brief notes could be useful as well, nothing major, just a small pop up for quick reference.
